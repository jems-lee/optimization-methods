# optimization-methods

Convex and non-convex optimization methods from scratch.
Key idea and implementation for each algorithm and use cases.

$ min_x f(x) $

subject to $g_i(x) <= 0$ for $i = 1, ..., n$

$Ax = b$

## Convex Problems

Key ideas:
- Local minimum is the global minimum

### First Order Methods
